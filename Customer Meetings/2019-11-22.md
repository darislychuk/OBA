Meeting with out customers: Pod B

""Clients are notoriously selfish" - our clients" - Michael Scott

- the green and blue rows should be text input
- can we go back to edit a course after we create it?
- 'term': don't let someone put their course in 2003
- 'status': consider not entered manually; generate it based on if the form is filled out or not
- remove the bubbles from the 'add course' button on the list page; that button should go directly to the course edit page. The first time, have dropdowns for 'program', 'course no.', 'term', 'year'; the second time these should be locked/readonly.
- the policy deadline for professors to submit their stuff is the end of the first month of the next semester (eg. for Fall, deadline is next January 31. Status should include 'late' if very late; whoever implements an email to auto-harass late professors will be awarded a steak dinner by the OBA committee).
- Rubrics should be ordered fail - developing - meets - exceeds and use the same verbage the excel sheet currently uses
- add visualization to the course edit sheet, like percentage failed, total students, etc.

Roles that the customers expect:
- professor: data entry and read for their own courses
- program chair: can read data of all courses in their program and all ENGG courses
- staff: can read data of everything

Notes not by the customers:
- can a prof download the file after they upload it?
